# Python Pyppeteer HTML to image
A simple script to convert HTML files to images (PNG, JPG) or to PDF

## Getting started
You need to clone this project and then install the dependencies (Pyppeteer):

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then simply run the given script from the command line:

```
./convert.py <input.html> <output.png>
```

A PNG file will be created in the current directory. If you simply 
change output file extension from *.png* to *.jpg* or *.pdf* you have a different output file.
